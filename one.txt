#Langchain = Is a framework for developing applicaions powered by LLMs

# Langchain simpilifies every stage of the LLM lifecycle:

#what is langchain??
  1) A developer way to get into AI  ex: interview with chatgpt 
  2) Give context to AI
  3) Use multi LLM in your Apps 
# ex: start with PDF summarizer

#problem:
   # every request --> question + Docs
   # High token --> More Bill $$

#solution:
#   take text --> Break into chnuk
#   summarize each chunk
#   find the must relative chunk to question
#   send chunk +  question to LLM (chatgpt,etc....)

#                   --->>> Embedding
#     text --> enbedding Algo --> embedding
#     embedding --> [0.8,0.72,0.3....]  array btw -1 & 1

#     each number is a score on relevancy scale
#  ex : is the text about youtube?
#       is it about coding?
#       is it about AI?
#       contains history....
#   problem --> Where to store these embeddings?
#       vector store (database for embeddings)
#        calculation on embeddingss

#   Flow:
#        -> take question & convert to embedding
#        -> find most relative embedding in DB
#        -> question + relative chunk -> chatgpt

# Landchain gives us tools to handle all of this in an easier way with multiple languages such as python or js
# ex: Get discord chat 

# Vector Databases 
#   PG vector
#   Pine cone ,chroma....

  Longchain even provides a wrapper for most popular databases for interact with them.
